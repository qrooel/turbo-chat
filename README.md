# turbo-chat

AS IS:

The turbo chatroom is a small application for users to talk to each other. You can sign up and send messages to other users, but if you send an unwanted message there is nothing nobody can do about it.

TO BE:

Write a companion app next to turbo chatroom that will help admins moderate the users activity. It needs following functionalites

login for admins
view of messages being sent
a button to hide given message. When it's pressed the message should be hidden in turbo chatroom
Connect the two applications however you want, any modifications you need in turbo chatroom to solve the ticket are most welcome.

Once done, pleace replace this readme with short documentation (bullet points) about what you did and why.
